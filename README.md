FollowUp is a web app that turns meeting transcripts into structured outputs like summaries, action items, email drafts, calendar suggestions, and blocker/risk notes. It uses a React + Vite frontend with Supabase (including Edge Functions) and NeuralSeek-powered agents for transcript analysis.

Made by Lara Gouda, Joseph Binu & Matthew Fernando from Stony Brook University at SBUHACKS 2025.
